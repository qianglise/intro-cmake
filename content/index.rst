Introduction to CMake
=====================


CMake is a language-agnostic, cross-platform build tool and is nowadays the *de facto* standard, with large projects using it to reliably build, test, and deploy their codebases.

CMake is not a build system itself, but it generates another system's build files.

In this workshop, you will learn

- Write a CMake build system for C/C++ and Fortran projects producing libraries and/or executables.
- Run tests for your code with `CTest`.
- Ensure your build system will work on different platforms.
- (optional) Detect and use external dependencies in your project.
- (optional) Safely and effectively build mixed-language projects (Python+C/C++, Python+Fortran, Fortran+C/C++)



.. prereq::

   Before attending this workshop, please make sure that you have access to a computer with a compiler for your favorite programming language and a recent version of CMake.
   
   If you have access to a supercomputer (e.g. a `NAISS system <https://www.naiss.se/>`_) with a compute allocation you can use that during    the workshop. Any questions on how to use a particular HPC resource should be    directed to the appropriate support desk.
   
   You can also use your own computer for this workshop, provided that it has the necessary tools installed.

   - If you do not already have these installed, we recommend that you set up an isolated software environment using ``conda``.
   - For Windows computers we recommend to use the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**. Detailed instructions can be found on the :doc:`setup` page.

Who is the course for?
----------------------

This course is for students, researchers, engineers, and programmers that have heard of `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_ and want to learn how to use it effectively with projects they are working on.
This course assumes no previous experience with `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_. You will have to be familiar with the tools commonly used to build software in your compiled language of choice (C/C++ or Fortran).

Specifically, this lesson assumes that participants have some prior experience with or knowledge of the following topics (but no expertise is required):

- Compiling and linking executables and libraries.
- Differences between shared and static libraries.
- Automated testing.



About this course
-----------------

This lesson material is originally developed by the `EuroCC National Competence Center Sweden (ENCCS) <https://enccs.se/>`_ and taught in the `CMake Workshop <https://enccs.github.io/cmake-workshop/>`_.
Each lesson episode has clearly defined learning objectives and includes multiple exercises along with solutions, and is therefore also useful for self-learning.

This material `Introduction to CMake <https://enccs.github.io/intro-cmake/>`_ was adapted from the material used for `CMake Workshop <https://enccs.github.io/cmake-workshop/>`_ and will be use for the `Build Systems Course and Hackathon <https://enccs.se/events/build-systems-course-and-hackathon-2024/>`_.

The lesson material is licensed under `CC-BY-4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_ and can be reused in any form (with appropriate credit) in other courses and workshops. Instructors who wish to teach this lesson can refer to the :doc:`guide` for practical advice.



Outreach
--------

There are many free online resources regarding CMake:

- The `CMake official documentation <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/cmake_minimum_required.html>`_.
- The `CMake tutorial <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/guide/tutorial/index.html#guide:CMake%20Tutorial>`_.
- The `HEP Software Foundation <https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cmake-webpage/>`_ training course.
- The `Building portable code with CMake <https://coderefinery.github.io/cmake/>`_ from the `CodeRefinery <https://coderefinery.org/>`_.


You can also consult the following books:

- **Professional CMake: A Practical Guide** by Craig Scott.
- **CMake Cookbook** by Radovan Bast and Roberto Di Remigio. The accompanying repository is on `GitHub <https://github.com/dev-cafe/cmake-cookbook>`_
